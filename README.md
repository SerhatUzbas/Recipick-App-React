### Recipick App

Recipick is the React project I created to practice my React knowledge.

### API

I used edamam API for recipes. Actually, I have started with spoonacular API, but because of request limit of spoonacular is too low, so I had to switch edamam.

I don't want to be rude, but in my opinion, edamam API has some flows:

1) There is no servings data.
2) There is no "how to cook" data.
3) Ingrediendnts are not well explained in some recipes.
4) Meal names are not explanatory and are not reflecting the original meal sometimes.
5) Very few meal types.

I want to make search function depends every key stroke, but 10 calls/min limit restricted me to do that.

On the other hand, 10000 calls/month ables you free to create demo project with edamam.
